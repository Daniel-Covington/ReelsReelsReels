# ReelsReelsReels

ReelsReelsReels is a web application that allows users to search for movie trailers and related videos.
With an easy-to-use interface, it provides movie details, popular movie trailers, and related search 
results from YouTube, all in one place.

## Features

* Search for movie trailers by entering a movie title.
* View movie details such as director, actors, and plot description.
* Watch movie trailers in an embedded video player.
* Browse related videos based on the searched movie title.
* Explore the most popular movie trailers at the time of page load.
* Save search history locally for easy access to previous searches.

## Getting Started
To set up ReelsReelsReels on your local machine, follow these instructions:

* Clone the repository.
* Install the required dependencies.
* Obtain API keys from [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) and [Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3).
* Replace the placeholders in the code with your API keys.
* Open the index.html file in your favorite browser.


## Technologies Used 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* OMDb API
* YouTube Data API v3

## Future Development
* For the related and popular trailer thumbnails, we would like for it to pass the trailer name from the youtube API to the search function with a click listen event, so it would be processed as if it was a searched trailer that hits omdb api and displays trailer/movie details and displays the trailer as the embedded main video.
